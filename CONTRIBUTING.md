## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to Muze, please start a discussion by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/urmilshroff/muze/issues/new/choose) first. It helps me understand your proposal and discuss wether it is necessary or not.

Alternatively, you can help by resolving any of the already [open issues](https://github.com/urmilshroff/muze/issues).

## Pull Requests

Please follow these steps for sending a pull request:

-   Make sure that an issue regarding your proposal is open (by you or someone else).
-   Refer to the [building instructions](https://github.com/urmilshroff/muze/blob/main/README.md#building) to run the app.
-   Make your changes and apply [dartfmt](https://dart.dev/tools/dartfmt) on the Dart code.
-   Commit all changes to your fork.
-   Send the PR from `{your-username}/muze:main` to `urmilshroff/muze:main`

***Note:*** the build CI workflow may fail due to some Secrets constraints with GitHub Actions. That's okay - I will check and merge your PR if satisfactory.
